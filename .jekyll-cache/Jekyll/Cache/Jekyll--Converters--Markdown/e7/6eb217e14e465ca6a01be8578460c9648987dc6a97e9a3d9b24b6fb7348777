<p>Iâ€™m Alex and this Iâ€™ll be using this site to showcase work I have done whether thatâ€™s projects or blog posts I have written. I studied Computer Science at the University of Exeter, in particular I enjoy the areas of Data Science, Evolutionary algorithms and Multi-objective optimisation. I like running (I have done the Bath Half twice) as well as tennis and orienteering. This blog will mainly contain development projects I have completed alongside any blog posts I come up with - probably about effective altruism, environmentalism and current affairs.</p>
